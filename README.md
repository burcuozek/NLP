# NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant. NLP involves the development of computational models and algorithms that can process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Key components and tasks within NLP include:

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Assigning grammatical categories (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives) to each word in a sentence.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities (such as names of people, locations, organizations) in text.

Syntax and Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences, including identifying relationships between words.

Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.

Text Summarization: Generating concise and meaningful summaries of longer pieces of text.

Question Answering: Designing systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.

Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into written text.

Coreference Resolution: Identifying when different words or phrases in a text refer to the same entity.

NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws on techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning. It plays a crucial role in various applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, language translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. Advances in NLP have been driven by the development of sophisticated algorithms, large datasets, and deep learning techniques.

Within this repository, I've incorporated the utilization of NLP applications using Python.
